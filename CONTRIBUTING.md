# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest in this project. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Discussion and general support is typically done through Discord and/or Email.

## We Use [Git Flow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow)

All code changes happen through pull requests and are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your own branch off of the `develop` branch.
2. Name your branch `feature/<name>-<hash>-<desc>` where:
  * `<name>` is your Github username
  * `<hash>` is equal to `echo "$(openssl rand -hex 2)"`
  * `<desc>` is a short description using hyphen as a separator
3. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you have changes APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure it passes whatever tests are being used.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue the pull request!


## Reporting Bugs / Feature Requests

We use Github issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug/feature by [opening a new issue](/../../issues); it is that easy!

## Contributions & Software Licensing

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](LICENSE) that covers the project itself. If you have a concern about this, please refrain from submitting a PR and contact a maintainer directly.
