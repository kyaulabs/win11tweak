## Disclaimer

Let's be honest, Windows has become a mammoth of an OS that is generically geared toward everyone. My goal with this set of scripts is to put the User back in control of the OS. That said, these scripts have been heavily customized to my own personal needs, it is highly recommended that if you are to use them you review them in their entirety first.

## Introduction

This script is meant to be utilized immediately after a fresh installation of Windows 11. Before the script can be run, Windows itself needs to be installed properly. The following will walk you through setting up Windows 11 with a local user account.

## Features

This set of scripts attempts to maintain a vanilla appearance while gutting most of the unneeded and/or unwanted items from the operating system. Privacy is another focus and as such any call home or telemetry functions have been disabled or out-right removed.

* Microsoft Bloat Removed

* Microsoft Telemetry/Tracking Stripped

* *(Optional)* Windows Defender Completed Removed

* Chocolatey Package Manger, manage packages like a Linux system

* MSYS2 is used for a Linux terminal

* Git for Windows is directly integrated into MSYS2, this uses the faster native version of Git with the added benefit of being able to use the default MSYS2 package manager `pacman`

* YubiKey Ready! [^1]

* *(Optional)* GPG and SSH key forwarding over SSH

* Many Visual Changes!
  
  * Start Menu shifted back to the left
  
  * Original Windows right-click menu restored
  
  * OpenShell is used for a customizable start menu experience

[^1]: This assumes you followed [drduh's YubiKey Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) in order to setup your YubiKey

### Configuration

While not required, in order to personalize your installation, it is recommended to edit `user_settings.ps1`.  Use any text editor or regular old Notepad to edit the file. This step will need to be done before the script can be run on a fresh installation. However, as Win11Tweaks can be baked into an installation to be run automatically, I have added this section up near the top so it does not get skipped over.

```
üìå NOTE
By default this file contains all of my own personal settings. At the very least you should change the Git
Email, GPG Public Key and then review over the list of software that Chocolatey is going to be installing.
```

## Windows 11 Tweaks Guide

### Installation

While this can be used with any version of Windows 11, this guide revolves around Windows 11 Pro N. In order to bypass the Microsoft Account requirements it is advised that you pull your network cable until Windows 11 is fully installed.

```
‚ùó DO NOT SKIP ‚ùó
If you do not plan on pulling your network cable you will be forced into logging in with a Microsoft
Account.
```

![Install_01](README_media/Install_01.png)

After installing Windows to the selected hard drive you will be prompted to reboot the computer. Upon completion, press `SHIFT+F10` to bring up a command prompt window.

![Install_02](README_media/Install_02b.png)

Run `oobe\bypassnro` in the command prompt window, this will reboot the machine automatically and then return you to the region selection window.

![Install_02](README_media/Install_02a.png)

Begin by selecting a region and keyboard (and a secondary keyboard layout if necessary).

![Install_03](README_media/Install_03.png)

Windows will now prompt you about having no internet connection, select `I don't have internet`.

![Install_05](README_media/Install_04.png)

It will double check that you are sure about using an offline account, select `Continue with limited setup`.

![Install_05](README_media/Install_05.png)

Set your desired username.

![Install_08](README_media/Install_08.png)

Set and confirm your password.

![Install_09](README_media/Install_09.png)

Fill in the three security questions.

![Install_10](README_media/Install_10.png)

Finally on the privacy settings screen, make sure you deselect every single option (scroll down for more options). Only after you have turned off all of Microsoft's tracking should you select `Accept` to complete the Windows 11 configuration.

![Install_11](README_media/Install_11.png)

### Windows Update

Eventually you will be able to login and will be presented with the desktop.

```
üìåNOTE
Now would be an acceptable time to plug your network cable back in.
```

Right-click on the Start Menu icon (bottom center of screen, left most icon). From here you will want to select `Settings`.

![Windows_01](README_media/Windows_01.png)

Navigate to `Windows Update`.

![Windows_02](README_media/Windows_02.png)

From here update Windows, you need to continue to check for updates after every update until Windows tells you that `You're up to date`.

![Windows_03](README_media/Windows_03.png)

Don't forget to also install optional updates as these tend to contain drivers, these have been moved inside Advanced options.

![Windows_04](README_media/Windows_04.png)

This will most likely require a reboot or a few. Once complete open the Windows Store from the taskbar (the briefcase with the Windows logo on it). Open the `Library` from the bottom left of the app.

![Windows_05](README_media/Windows_05.png)

Select `Get updates` in the upper right corner of the window.

![Windows_06](README_media/Windows_06.png)

Verify that you have performed all updates by the store telling you `You're good to go`.

![Windows_07](README_media/Windows_07.png)

At this point (if it has not been done already) activate Windows.

With the computer updated and activated it is now time to download the script. Download the latest version of Win11Tweaks. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to the Desktop, this should place a folder `win11tweak` on the Desktop.

### Windows Defender (optional)

```
üöß WARNING
If you choose to keep Windows Defender installed, the script used to disable Defender _defender.ps1_ will
get flagged by Defender itself, this is normal behavior.
```

Before the main script can be run Windows Defender needs to be disabled along with tamper protection.

Select the Security Center icon in the system tray and navigate to the security dashboard.

![Defender_01](README_media/Defender_01.png)

Navigate to `Virus & threat protection` and select `Manage settings`.

![Defender_02](README_media/Defender_02.png)

Turn off `Real-time protection`,  `Cloud-delivered protection`, `Automatic sample submission` and `Tamper Protection` inside of Virus & threat protection settings.

![Defender_03](README_media/Defender_03.png)

### Download Win11Tweaks

Right-click on the Start Menu icon and select `Terminal (Admin)`. Run the following command in PowerShell.

```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/kyaulabs/win11tweak/raw/master/Modules/download.ps1'))
```

![Download_01](README_media/Download_01.png)

This will download a copy of Win11Tweaks and place it on your desktop. You can then close out of Windows Terminal.

### Anti-Virus (optional)

Run `download_av.cmd` inside of the `win11tweak` folder on the desktop.

![AntiVirus_01](README_media/AntiVirus_01.png)

This will download Adaware Antivirus to your desktop, then run the installer `Adaware.exe`. Select `Install` to install Adaware.

![AntiVirus_02](README_media/AntiVirus_02.png)

When asked if you want an extra layer of protection, select `NO THANKS`.

![AntiVirus_03](README_media/AntiVirus_03.png)

Once installation is finished, feel free to delete the `Adaware.exe` on your desktop.  If by chance MSEdge pops up with incoherent text, go to the Task Manager by right clicking on the Start Menu and selecting `Task Manager`. Find `Microsoft Edge` and expand it to find `Browser`, right-click on this and choose `End task`.

![AntiVirus_04](README_media/AntiVirus_04.png)

Given a bit of time Adaware should finish its initial scan and present you with a screen similar to the following.

![AntiVirus_05](README_media/AntiVirus_05.png)

Close out of Adaware.

```
üìå NOTE
Installation of a 3rd party Anti-Virus product has been added in order to get Windows Defender to disable
itself. Without this step you will be unable to completely remove Windows Defender from Windows 11.
```

### Running Win11Tweaks

Assuming the scripts have been extracted to your Desktop... Open the start menu and search for `cmd`, this should bring up the listing for Command Prompt. Make sure you choose the option on the right `Run as administrator`.

```
üöß WARNING
Do not simply run the script from Windows Explorer, this will fail and/or produce unintentional results.
```

![Windows_08](README_media/Windows_08.png)

Change directory into the extracted folder `cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\win11tweak`. 

Finally run the script using `main.cmd`.

![Windows_09](README_media/Windows_09.png)

The script will take quite a while to finish, at some point it will ask you to uninstall the two Microsoft Edge components. If this happens you will be presented with the following screen, make sure to select `Uninstall` for both.

![Script_01](README_media/Script_01.png)

```
‚ùó DO NOT SKIP ‚ùó
It is possible that the second of which, uninstalling MSEdge itself, will popup two Internet Explorer
errors in the background. These errors will need to be cleared by ALT+TABing and selecting _OK_ before
the script can continue.
```

Upon completion it will reboot automatically. After the reboot the last part of the script will run automatically after login and then remove itself (via scheduled task).

### Anti-Virus Removal (optional)

Once Win11Tweaks is completely done with all of its scripts, you will be left at the Windows Desktop. If you wish to remove all anti-virus completely, right-click the Start Menu and select `Installed apps`. Select the three-dot menu to the right of `adaware antivirus` and choose `Uninstall`.

![AntiVirus_06](README_media/AntiVirus_06.png)

Make sure to select `SKIP` when asked if you want to reenable Windows Defender.

![AntiVirus_07](README_media/AntiVirus_07.png)

Go ahead and reboot to complete the uninstallation.

Post reboot, if you open Security Center and navigate to `Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings` you will see that Windows Defender is completely disabled.

![AntiVirus_08](README_media/AntiVirus_08.png)

### Configuring Windows

Right-click on the desktop and choose `Personalize`. Navigate to `Themes` and set the mouse cursor theme to `Snow Leopard`.

![Config_01](README_media/Config_01.png)

Click `Color`, change `Choose your color` to `Custom` and then the default Windows mode to `Dark` and the default App mode to `Light`.

![Config_02](README_media/Config_02.png)

Set the accent color to `Manual` then click `View colors`. Selecting `More` will allow you to set a hex color code. Change it to `#131313` (Black) and enable accent color on `Start, taskbar, and action center` and `Title bars and window borders`.

![Config_03](README_media/Config_03.png)

### Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal (WT) is now the defacto Windows terminal and can easily be used for CMD, PowerShell, SSH, WSL and more. To access WT right-click the Start Menu and select `Terminal (Admin)`. Select `Open Settings` from the toolbar warning about the default terminal application.

![WT_01](README_media/WT_01.png)

Once open, use the dropdown menu underneath `Default terminal application` and select `Windows Terminal`, then click `Save` in the bottom right.

![WT_02](README_media/WT_02.png)

```
üìå NOTE
After OpenShell is installed you will find example shortcuts for SSH and RDP in the Start Menu under the
KYAU Labs section (feel free to rename to the name of your network).
```

### OpenShell

OpenShell, which is the continued version of ClassicShell, should be on the desktop with a settings XML file ready for import. Install OpenShell, removing the un-needed modules.

![OpenShell_01](README_media/OpenShell_01.png)

After installation press the Windows key on your keyboard in order to open the settings dialog for Open-Shell. Click `Backup` and then `Load from an XML file...` choosing the provided XML file on the desktop.

![OpenShell_02](README_media/OpenShell_02.png)

```
üìå NOTE
OpenShell has not yet been fully updated for Windows 11, there are still quite a few bugs/glitches.
```

If you need to make changes to the Start Menu, enable `Show all settings` and then navigate to the `Customize Start Menu` tab.

When finished, select `OK` in the bottom right to save the changes. It will prompt you to Exit and reload OpenShell. Right-click the Start Menu and choose `Exit` (maybe twice). Then click the Start Menu and re-launch `Open-Shell Menu Settings`. Finally, select `OK` to close settings.

### Brave

```
üöß WARNING
Naturally this can be replaced with a browser of your choosing, I would recommend you at least give Brave a
try if you have never used it.
```

Next, install the Brave web browser with the `BraveSetup.exe` on the desktop which has been pre-downloaded for you. Once open, feel free to click `Skip welcome tour` in the bottom-left corner.

Next scroll down a little to bring up the Brave News banner and select `No thanks`. The select the 3dots menu for `Brave Rewards` and select `Hide Brave Rewards`.

Navigate to the hamburger menu in the upper-right and select `Extensions`. In the center you should see `Find extensions and themes in the Web Store`, click on `Web Store` to continue, this should launch in a separate tab.

Extensions are typical revolve heavily around personal choice, however there are a few extensions that deal with privacy/security that I would recommend to everyone.

* [Cookie AutoDelete](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh)
* [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj)
* [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)

Navigate to the hamburger menu again and select Settings. Under `Appearance` set `Brave colors` to `Dark` to force Brave into dark mode.

![Brave_01a](README_media/Brave_01a.png)

Then deselect `Show top sites in autocomplete suggestions` and select `Always show full URLs`.

![Brave_01b](README_media/Brave_01b.png)

Under `Shields` change `Trackers & ad blocking` to `Aggressive`.

![Brave_02](README_media/Brave_02.png)

Under `Social media blocking` deselect all platforms that you do not use.

![Brave_03](README_media/Brave_03.png)

Under `Privacy and security` deselect everything.

![Brave_04](README_media/Brave_04.png)

Under `Search engine` swap the `Search engine used in the address bar` to the one of your choice, I recommend `DuckDuckGo` personally.

![Brave_05](README_media/Brave_05.png)

Under `Extensions` deselect `WebTorrent` if you use an external torrent client, and select `Widevine` if you plan on using streaming services with this browser.

```
üìå NOTE
Enabling Widevine DRM will require a restart of Brave, you will be returned to where you left off in
Settings after the restart.
```

![Brave_06](README_media/Brave_06.png)

Under `Autofill` > `Passwords` deselect `Offer to save passwords` and `Auto Sign-In`.

![Brave_07](README_media/Brave_07.png)

Under `Autofill` > `Payment methods` deselect `Save and fill payment methods` and `Allow sites to check if you have payment methods saved`.

![Brave_08](README_media/Brave_08.png)

Under `Autofill` > `Addresses and more` deselect `Save and fill addresses`.

![Brave_09](README_media/Brave_09.png)

### Firewall

In the Utilities section of the Start Menu is simplewall, launch it and allow it to update if needed.

![Simplewall_01](README_media/Simplewall_01.png)

In the `Settings` menu enable `Load on system startup`,  `Start minimized`, and `Skip "User Account Control" prompt warning`.

![Simplewall_02](README_media/Simplewall_02.png)

Click `Enable filters` in the toolbar then again in the popup dialog in order to permanently replace the Windows Firewall with SimpleWall.

Applications will popup asking for internet access, stuff that is required for Windows to function are as follows (it is safe to allow everything in this list):

* `dashost.exe`: wired/wireless device pairing

* `Microsoft Content`: part of search
* `Microsoft Store`: the store uwp app
* `mousocoreworker.exe`: Windows update client

Things to block:

* `Windows Feature Experience Pack`: Windows Start Menu ads and telemetry

Past this, things to allow are at your discretion. Generally I won't allow any installers access to the internet unless they need to download the installation material, and then I give them timed access (only 10 minutes for example). Some things will be easy to choose to allow; like a web browser or email client.

When in doubt, choose the `X` instead of block and if the program fails to work, re-launch the program and you will be asked again and can this time select allow.

### Chocolatey

Launch the package manager `Chocolatey GUI` from the Start Menu in the Utilities submenu. Click the `settings` button in the upper right of the application.

![Choco_01](README_media/Choco_01.png)

Turn off the options `DefaultToTileViewForLocalSource` and `DefaultToTileViewForRemoteSource`.

![Choco_02](README_media/Choco_02.png)

Scroll to the bottom and enable the two options `DefaultToDarkMode` and `PreventUsageOfUpdateAllButton`. Closing setting by clicking the round left arrow button to the left of the Settings title.

![Choco_03](README_media/Choco_03.png)

When updates are detected you will see a new version listed to the right of current versions highlighted with the color red. To update, simple right click the application and choose `Update`.

![Choco_04](README_media/Choco_04.png)
